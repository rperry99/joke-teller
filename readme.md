# Project Name

This is a little app where a voice will tell you a joke from a joke API

This project is from [Zero to Mastery: Jacascript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://academy.zerotomastery.io/p/javascript-projects).
This is project 4 / 20.

## Live Project

You can view a live version [here](https://russ-joke-machine.netlify.app/). If you would like to run this locally, you will need an API key, which you can get for free from the steps below.

## Thoughts

I have created text to speech projects in the past. This one was different in that it used a joke API to speak the joke. This was a pretty interesting project. It's a neat little app that can be fun for a few minutes listening to your computer tell you some jokes.

## My Cusomizations

Something I added myself was three options on the page to let the user choose the kinds of jokes they want. This can give the user a little more customizations on what they want to listen to.

## Running this Locally

1. Go to the documentation page for the Voice RSS Text to Speech API page found [here](http://www.voicerss.org/tts/default.aspx)
2. Click on 'Get API Key' on the left nav bar.
3. Create a free account.
4. When your account is created, you need to activate the account by clicking the 'Activate Account' button on the sign up page.
5. Once your account is activated, you can copy your API key and paste it into the script.js file.
   - Line 18, replace 'config.MY_KEY' with your API key contained in single quotes.
